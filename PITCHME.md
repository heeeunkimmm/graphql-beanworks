### What is GraphQL?

---
#### Query Language used for requesting data on a server

---
#### Only get what you asked for

You asked for 
```json zoom-18
query  {
  currentUser {
    visibleLegalEntities {
      display
    }
  }
}
```

---
You get 
```json zoom-18
{
  "data": {
    "currentUser": {
      "visibleLegalEntities": [
        {
          "display": "Alberta"
        },
        {
          "display": "Ontario"
        },
        {
          "display": "Quebec"
        },
        {
          "display": "British Columbia"
        }
      ]
    }
```

---
#### Many resources with one request thanks to references
You asked for 
```json zoom-18
query  {
  currentUser {
    visibleLegalEntities {
      display
    }
    permissions
  }
}
```

---
You get 
```json zoom-18
{
  "data": {
    "currentUser": {
      "visibleLegalEntities": [
        {
          "display": "Alberta"
        },
        {
          "display": "Ontario"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "permissions": [
        "approveAndReject",
        "archivesView",
        "batchApproveAndReject",
        "beanboardView",
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Typed üôè
```yaml zoom-18
fields:
  syncToolId:
    type: ID!
  legalEntityId:
    type: ID!
  lastSyncDate:
    type: DateTime

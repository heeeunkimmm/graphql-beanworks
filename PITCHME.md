### What is GraphQL?

---
### Query Language used for requesting data on a server

---
### Only get what you asked for

You asked for 
```json zoom-18
query  {
  currentUser {
    visibleLegalEntities {
      display
    }
  }
}
```

---
You get 
```json zoom-18
{
  "data": {
    "currentUser": {
      "visibleLegalEntities": [
        {
          "display": "Alberta"
        },
        {
          "display": "Ontario"
        },
        {
          "display": "Quebec"
        },
        {
          "display": "British Columbia"
        },
        {
          "display": "Yukon"
        },
        {
          "display": "New Zealand"
        },
        {
          "display": "Manitoba"
        },
        {
          "display": "Alaska"
        },
        {
          "display": "New York"
        },
        {
          "display": "Florida"
        }
      ]
    }
```

#### GraphQL vs REST API

@ul[list-spaced-bullets]
- No more different endpoint! 
- Independent work for SyncTool, UI and API team
